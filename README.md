# Food_Delivery_WebPage
This is a landing page for a random food delivery website,
It is created using HTML and CSS, In HTML i have used various tags like h1,h2,h3 and p tags for writing content.
section tags for creating different section of the page and input tags for creating a sign up section. 
there is also a footer section in which i have displayed copyright part.
In CSS i have majorly used flex box and grid box for alligning the content, and in cards part, i have used transitions so that when it is get hovered it can show some effet.

### It is a responsive page, a seperate CSS file is created and media query is used . This is how it looks in a mobile phone.
